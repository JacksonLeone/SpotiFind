<h2>Expand your playlist</h2>
<h3>Intro/Background </h3>
<p>Our team aims to create a tool that finds related songs and artists through the Spotify Developer API through favorite artists and songs. 
    We also aim for this tool to be able to create curated playlists based on these related artists and given a specific mood. </p>

<h3>Problem Definition</h3>
<p>We're tired of listening to the same music every day. We want to train an AI to recommend new music to us based on our personal preferences. 
    By taking the attributes of the songs we like, we want to be given a playlist personally tailored to our tastes in music. </p>

<h3>Data Collection</h3>
<p>To collect our data, we will be using Spotify's API to gather information about the top songs of a given year; this information includes acousticness, 
    danceability, energy, length, instrumentalness, key, liveness, loudness, mode, speechiness, tempo,  and valence. These features are given by Spotify itself, 
    and they can be used as effective indicators to classify songs by genre. To get a good sample of songs, we've decided to gather the top 1000 songs released 
    per year over the last 5 years. </p>

<h3>Methods</h3>
<p>To tune the best recommendations, we plan on cleaning our data using PCA to reduce the dimensionality of our dataset to 3 and narrowing down the optimal 
    directions to project and evaluate the features on. Then, we will use DBScan to separate our data into clusters. With this, we should be able to input a 
    song, extract its important features, and find enough songs with similarities in these features to generate a playlist. </p>

<h3>Results and Discussion</h3>
<p>From our analysis of the most popular songs from the past 5 years, we found through our PCA and DBScan that the duration, tempo, and loudness of a song were 
    very influential in indicating similarities between songs, whereas mode, liveliness, and speechiness didn't seem to matter as much. From this data, we can 
    make some inferences; songs in similar genres/styles may tend to have a consistent structure and tempo, causing their lengths to converge to a relatively 
    small range. This revelation gives a sneak peak into the playlist our project will create when given a song that a user wants more of.<br></p>
